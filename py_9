MANIPULATING STRINGS 

* Escape Characters 

Escape character	Prints as
\'	Single quote
\"	Double quote
\t	Tab
\n	Newline (line break)
\\	Backslash


Escape characters lets you use characters that would otherwise not be allowed to be used in a string ..

An escape character consists of a backslash (\) followed by the character you want to add to the string. 

    L = 'by: kalistamp\’s mother'

    print(L.title())

    #
    #End


By using the escape character at the end of kalistamp we were able to add the apostrophe “s” to the end of it ...

* Raw Strings

You can put and “r” before the beginning of the quotation to make it a raw string (Similar to using “f” before to format the string)

This can be useful for something like printing a filepath  ...

Raw strings are helpful if you are typing string values that contain many backslashes, such as the strings used for Windows file paths like r'C:\Users\Al\Desktop' or regular expressions
